# Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [third project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this, which used Numpy to produce plots by analysing provided medical data. 

### Workflow
[Notes on the full task brief](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt) for this were first written. CSV data involving the medical information of patients was first provided ([medical_examination.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/medical_examination.csv)). Python was desired which produced two output plots for this data. Two aim plots were provided for this, and are in the [Aim](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Aim) directory in this repository. The `draw_cat_plot` and `draw_heat_map` functions were next written in the project [medical_data_visualizer.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer.py) file. This performed calculations on the project data and generated the plots in the [Output Files](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project/tree/main/Output%20Files) directory. Project files were pushed to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/main.py)) had successfully passed and its URL was submitted. This aided in developing statistical and data analytics skills with Numpy and marked the completion of the third project in the course.
