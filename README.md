# Medical-Data-Visualiser-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python#data-analysis-with-python-course) certification, to invest in my data analytics skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work as part of the [third project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) in this curriculum. I devised a Python script for this, which used Numpy to answer nine questions about 1994 census data. 

### Workflow
CSV data for a 1994 census ([adult.data.csv](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/tree/main/data)) was first provided. The `calculate_demographic_data` function was written, which performed calculations on this data to answer nine questions. [Notes on the full task brief](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt) for this were first written. Each problem for this project was solved by first pasting it into the comments in the [demographic_data_analyzer.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py) file. Problem-solving thought processes for each of these were written in the [data_analyzer Problem Solving Notes.pdf](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/data_analyzer%20Problem%20Solving%20Notes.pdf) file. These problem-solving approaches were coded into Python in the project demographic_data_analyzer.py file. This process was repeated for nine questions, to perform calculations on the census data. Project files were pushed to this repository once all unit tests ([test_module.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/test_module.py) and [main.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Data-Analysis-Python-Demographic-Data-Analyser-Project/blob/main/main.py)) had successfully passed and its URL was submitted. This aided in developing statistical and data analytics skills with Numpy and marked the completion of the second project in the course.
